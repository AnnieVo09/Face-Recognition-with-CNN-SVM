# Face-Recognition-with-CNN-SVM

This project uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) built in Keras to perform facial recognition on the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset from scikit-learn. The goal is to accurately identify different celebrities based on photographs of their faces.

## Contents

The Jupyter notebook:

- Imports the LFW dataset
- Splits data into train and test sets 
- Defines CNN architecture with convolution, pooling, dropout and dense layers
- Compiles and trains model
- Makes predictions on test set
- Evaluates model accuracy 
- Visualizes some predictions

It also shows the full CNN architecture visualization produced by VisualKeras.
